# steam-deck-scripts

Simple scripts to use on your Steam Deck

## Rotate screen right

This script rotates the screen to the right and starts steam in big picture mode.
After closing steam the screen orientation will be resetted.

This is great for games that benefit to be played in tate mode and don't have a rotate feature integrated like older pinball or arcade games.

> If an external screen is connected, this screen will be rotated instead. 

## Reset screen orientation

Resets the screen orientation to the default orientation.

> If an external screen is connected, the orientation of this screen will be resetted instead.
