Simple scripts to use on your Steam Deck

## Rotate screen right

Rotates the screen to the right to use it in tate mode. It also starts steam in big picture mode.
This is great for games that benefit to be played in tate mode and don't have a rotate feature integrated e.g. `Pinball Arcade` or `Pinball Wicked`

## Reset screen orientation
